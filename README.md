A local university wants to develop a new interactive system – CLIUniApp - that offers access to two interactive subsystems for students and admins separately. CLIUniApp stores students’ data into a local file students.data, with all CRUD operations interacting with this file. Students accessing the student subsystem have the choice to login (if they are previously registered) or register. A registered student can enrol in a maximum of four (4) subjects, remove a subject, change password, and view enrolment. Admins already exist in the system and do not need to register. An admin using the admin subsystem can remove a student from the students.data, partition students to PASS/FAIL categories, group students by grade, view all students, and clear all student data. Develop the software using your preferred IDE in Java or Python with reference to the requirement analysis, modelling and design in Assessment 1
